# An implementation of Multiple Producers - Multiple Consumers Problem

The program can accept arguments from command line in the following way:
./main [Number_Producers Number_Consumers Max_Sleep_Seconds Total_Number_Items2Produce Ring_Buffer_Size]

Such as:
./main 3 2 1 32 128
This command would set:
Number_Producers: 3
Number_Consumers: 2
Max_Sleep_Seconds: 1
Total_Number_Items2Produce: 32
Ring_Buffer_Size: 128

By default these parameters have values:
Number_Producers: 1
Number_Consumers: 1
Max_Sleep_Seconds: 1
Total_Number_Items2Produce: 32
Ring_Buffer_Size: 128
