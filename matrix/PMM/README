The program can accept arguments from the command line strictly in the following order:
Matrix size, Number of threads

E.g. ./main 3 4
The program would generate 2 3x3 matrices with random number and calculate their multiplication result.
For the parallel version of it, 4 threads would be spawned to carry out the tasks

If no arguments passed through command line, the defaul values of them are 2, 2 respectively.
E.g. ./main is equal to ./main 2 2
